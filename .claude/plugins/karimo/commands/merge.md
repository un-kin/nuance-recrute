# /karimo:merge — Feature Branch Merge Command

Consolidate feature branch changes and create final PR to main. This completes the v5.0 feature branch workflow after all task PRs have been merged.

## Arguments

- `--prd {slug}` (required): The PRD slug to merge.
- `--skip-validation` (optional): Skip validation suite (use with caution).
- `--auto-merge` (optional): Automatically merge PR after creation (requires passing validation).

## Prerequisites

Before merge, the PRD must be:
1. **Orchestrated** via `/karimo:run` (execution_mode: "feature-branch")
2. **All tasks complete** (status: "ready-for-merge")
3. **Feature branch exists** with all task commits

## Behavior

### 1. Validation

Verify the PRD is ready for merge:

```bash
# 1. Check status.json
status=$(jq -r '.status' .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json)
execution_mode=$(jq -r '.execution_mode' .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json)
feature_branch=$(jq -r '.feature_branch' .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json)

if [ "$status" != "ready-for-merge" ]; then
  echo "❌ PRD not ready for merge (status: $status)"
  echo "   Expected: ready-for-merge"
  echo "   Hint: Run /karimo:run --prd {slug} first"
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$execution_mode" != "feature-branch" ]; then
  echo "❌ PRD not using feature branch mode"
  echo "   This command is for v5.0 feature branch workflow only"
  echo "   For direct-to-main PRDs, tasks are already merged"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Check feature branch exists
if ! git ls-remote --heads origin "$feature_branch" | grep -q "$feature_branch"; then
  echo "❌ Feature branch not found: $feature_branch"
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Check all tasks merged to feature branch
open_prs=$(gh pr list --label karimo-${prd_slug} --base "$feature_branch" --state open --json number --jq 'length')
if [ "$open_prs" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ $open_prs task PRs still open to feature branch"
  gh pr list --label karimo-${prd_slug} --base "$feature_branch" --state open
  echo "   Wait for all task PRs to merge before running /karimo:merge"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ PRD ready for merge"
```

### 2. Pre-Merge Display

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Merge Review: user-profiles                                 │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Feature Branch: feature/user-profiles
Target: main

Tasks Complete: 5/5
  ✓ [1a] Create UserProfile component (PR #42)
  ✓ [1b] Add user type definitions (PR #43)
  ✓ [2a] Implement profile edit form (PR #44)
  ✓ [2b] Add avatar upload (PR #45)
  ✓ [3a] Integration tests (PR #46)

All PRs merged to feature branch ✓

```

### 3. Checkout Feature Branch

```bash
# Fetch latest and checkout feature branch
git fetch origin
git checkout "$feature_branch"
git pull origin "$feature_branch"

echo "✓ On feature branch: $feature_branch"
```

### 4. Generate Consolidated Diff

**Show unified diff from feature branch to main:**

```bash
# Get diff stats
files_changed=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --stat | tail -1)
additions=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --numstat | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')
deletions=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --numstat | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}')

# Calculate markdown-specific statistics
md_files_changed=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --name-status | grep -E '\.(md|mdx)$' | wc -l | awk '{print $1}')
md_files_created=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --name-status | grep -E '^A.*\.(md|mdx)$' | wc -l | awk '{print $1}')

# Calculate markdown line additions/deletions
md_stats=$(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --numstat | grep -E '\.(md|mdx)$')
if [ -n "$md_stats" ]; then
  md_additions=$(echo "$md_stats" | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')
  md_deletions=$(echo "$md_stats" | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}')
else
  md_additions=0
  md_deletions=0
fi

# Calculate code-only statistics (total minus markdown)
code_files_changed=$(($(git diff main..."$feature_branch" --name-status | wc -l | awk '{print $1}') - md_files_changed))
code_additions=$((additions - md_additions))
code_deletions=$((deletions - md_deletions))

echo "Consolidated Changes:"
echo "  Files changed: $files_changed"
echo "  Additions: +${additions} lines"
echo "  Deletions: -${deletions} lines"
echo ""
```

**Present file-level summary:**

```bash
git diff main..."$feature_branch" --name-status | while read status file; do
  case $status in
    A) echo "  + $file (new)" ;;
    M) echo "  ~ $file (modified)" ;;
    D) echo "  - $file (deleted)" ;;
  esac
done
```

### 4b. Worktree Cleanup Verification (Discovery-Based)

**Verify all worktrees cleaned up from wave transitions. Uses discovery-based detection to handle both KARIMO naming (`worktree/{prd-slug}-{task-id}`) and Claude Code internal naming (`worktree-agent-{hash}`):**

```bash
# Extract PRD slug from feature branch
# Branch naming: feature/{prd-slug}
prd_slug=$(echo "$feature_branch" | sed 's|^feature/||')
cleanup_errors=0

echo "Running pre-merge worktree cleanup verification..."

# Phase 1: Check for stale worktree directories
if [ -d ".worktrees/${prd_slug}" ]; then
  stale_count=$(find ".worktrees/${prd_slug}" -type d -mindepth 1 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

  if [ "$stale_count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Found $stale_count stale worktrees for ${prd_slug}"
    echo "   These should have been cleaned up during wave transitions."
    echo "   Cleaning up now..."

    for wt in .worktrees/${prd_slug}/*; do
      if [ -d "$wt" ]; then
        wt_name=$(basename "$wt")
        if git worktree remove "$wt" 2>/dev/null; then
          echo "   Removed worktree: $wt_name"
        else
          echo "   ERROR: Failed to remove worktree: $wt_name"
          cleanup_errors=$((cleanup_errors + 1))
        fi
      fi
    done
  else
    echo "✓ No stale worktrees in .worktrees/${prd_slug}/"
  fi
else
  echo "✓ No worktree directory found (cleanup already complete)"
fi

# Phase 2: Discovery-based branch cleanup
echo "Running discovery audit for stale branches..."

# Find KARIMO-pattern stale branches (local)
for branch in $(git branch --list "worktree/${prd_slug}-*" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^[* ]*//' || true); do
  if git branch -D "$branch" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   Deleted stale local: $branch"
  else
    echo "   WARN: Could not delete local: $branch"
  fi
done

# Find Claude Code internal pattern branches (local)
for branch in $(git branch --list 'worktree-agent-*' 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^[* ]*//' || true); do
  if git branch -D "$branch" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   Deleted stale local: $branch"
  fi
done

# Remote cleanup for KARIMO pattern
for branch in $(git ls-remote --heads origin 2>/dev/null | \
    grep -E "worktree/${prd_slug}-" | \
    awk -F'refs/heads/' '{print $2}' || true); do
  if git push origin --delete "$branch" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   Deleted stale remote: $branch"
  else
    echo "   WARN: Could not delete remote: $branch"
  fi
done

# Remote cleanup for Claude Code internal pattern
for branch in $(git ls-remote --heads origin 2>/dev/null | \
    grep -E "worktree-agent-" | \
    awk -F'refs/heads/' '{print $2}' || true); do
  if git push origin --delete "$branch" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   Deleted stale remote: $branch"
  fi
done

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
echo "   Pruned stale worktree references"

if [ "$cleanup_errors" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  $cleanup_errors cleanup errors occurred"
else
  echo "✓ Pre-merge cleanup complete"
fi
echo ""
```

**Why this step:**

Task worktrees should be cleaned up during wave transitions (PM Agent Step 3e). However, if the agent session ends mid-wave or before reaching cleanup, worktrees may persist. This verification step ensures:

1. Only the feature branch exists at merge time
2. No stale worktrees interfere with the final PR
3. Remote branches are cleaned up before merge

---

### 5. Run Validation Suite

**Execute validation commands from config.yaml:**

```
Running validation suite...

  → Build... ✓ (12s)
  → Typecheck... ✓ (3s)
  → Lint... ✓ (2s)
  → Tests... ✓ (18s)
    15 tests, all passing

✓ All validations passed
```

**Validation logic:**

```bash
# Load validation commands from config.yaml
build_cmd=$(yq '.commands.build' .karimo/config.yaml)
typecheck_cmd=$(yq '.commands.typecheck' .karimo/config.yaml)
lint_cmd=$(yq '.commands.lint' .karimo/config.yaml)
test_cmd=$(yq '.commands.test' .karimo/config.yaml)

validation_failed=false

# Run build
if [ -n "$build_cmd" ] && [ "$build_cmd" != "null" ]; then
  echo "  → Build..."
  if eval "$build_cmd" > /tmp/karimo-build.log 2>&1; then
    echo "    ✓ Build passed"
  else
    echo "    ✗ Build failed"
    cat /tmp/karimo-build.log
    validation_failed=true
  fi
fi

# Run typecheck
if [ -n "$typecheck_cmd" ] && [ "$typecheck_cmd" != "null" ]; then
  echo "  → Typecheck..."
  if eval "$typecheck_cmd" > /tmp/karimo-typecheck.log 2>&1; then
    echo "    ✓ Typecheck passed"
  else
    echo "    ✗ Typecheck failed"
    cat /tmp/karimo-typecheck.log
    validation_failed=true
  fi
fi

# Run lint
if [ -n "$lint_cmd" ] && [ "$lint_cmd" != "null" ]; then
  echo "  → Lint..."
  if eval "$lint_cmd" > /tmp/karimo-lint.log 2>&1; then
    echo "    ✓ Lint passed"
  else
    echo "    ✗ Lint failed"
    cat /tmp/karimo-lint.log
    validation_failed=true
  fi
fi

# Run tests
if [ -n "$test_cmd" ] && [ "$test_cmd" != "null" ]; then
  echo "  → Tests..."
  if eval "$test_cmd" > /tmp/karimo-test.log 2>&1; then
    echo "    ✓ Tests passed"
    # Parse test count from output
    test_count=$(grep -oP '\d+(?= tests?)' /tmp/karimo-test.log | head -1)
    if [ -n "$test_count" ]; then
      echo "      $test_count tests, all passing"
    fi
  else
    echo "    ✗ Tests failed"
    cat /tmp/karimo-test.log
    validation_failed=true
  fi
fi

if [ "$validation_failed" = true ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "❌ Validation failed"
  echo "   Fix issues on feature branch and retry: /karimo:merge --prd {slug}"
  exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "✓ All validations passed"
```

**If `--skip-validation` is provided:**

```
⚠ Skipping validation suite (--skip-validation)

WARNING: Proceeding without validation may introduce issues to main.
Only use this flag if you've manually verified the feature branch.
```

### 5b. Coverage Analysis (Conditional)

**Detect if coverage reports exist and spawn coverage reviewer:**

```bash
# Detect coverage format (codebase-agnostic)
coverage_file=""
format=""

if [ -f "coverage/coverage-summary.json" ]; then
  coverage_file="coverage/coverage-summary.json"
  format="istanbul"
elif [ -f "coverage/lcov.info" ]; then
  coverage_file="coverage/lcov.info"
  format="lcov"
elif [ -f "coverage.xml" ]; then
  coverage_file="coverage.xml"
  format="cobertura"
elif [ -f ".coverage" ]; then
  coverage_file=".coverage"
  format="python"
fi

# If coverage exists, spawn coverage review agent
if [ -n "$coverage_file" ]; then
  echo "Coverage report detected: $coverage_file (format: $format)"
  echo "Spawning coverage reviewer..."

  # Spawn karimo-coverage-reviewer agent to analyze coverage and add PR comments
  # Agent will:
  # 1. Parse coverage report
  # 2. Cross-reference with task briefs for intentionally uncovered lines
  # 3. Add explanatory comment to PR
fi
```

**If no coverage report found:**
```
Note: No coverage report detected. Skipping coverage analysis.
```

### 5c. Deferred Findings Gate

**Verify findings deferred during automated review have been resolved:**

```bash
deferred_file="${prd_path}/deferred_findings.md"
unresolved_count=0
warnings=""

if [ -f "$deferred_file" ]; then
  echo "Checking deferred findings from automated review..."

  # Parse future-work-overlap entries
  while IFS='|' read -r finding classification; do
    [ -z "$finding" ] && continue

    case "$classification" in
      future-work-overlap:*)
        # Extract file path from detail
        file_path=$(echo "$classification" | sed 's/future-work-overlap:File //' | cut -d' ' -f1)

        if [ -n "$file_path" ]; then
          if [ -f "$file_path" ]; then
            echo "  ✓ $file_path now exists"
          else
            echo "  ⚠ $file_path still missing"
            warnings="${warnings}  - File not found: $file_path\n"
            unresolved_count=$((unresolved_count + 1))
          fi
        fi
        ;;
      false-positive-factual:*)
        # These are logged for audit, not re-checked
        echo "  ○ Logged: $(echo "$finding" | head -c 40)..."
        ;;
    esac
  done < <(grep -E '^\- .+\|' "$deferred_file" | sed 's/^- //')

  if [ "$unresolved_count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮"
    echo "│  ⚠  DEFERRED FINDINGS WARNING                                │"
    echo "╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯"
    echo ""
    echo "$unresolved_count future-work-overlap items unresolved:"
    echo -e "$warnings"
    echo ""
    echo "These files were expected to be created by later tasks but are missing."
    echo ""

    # Ask user how to proceed
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  [1] Proceed anyway (log in PR description)"
    echo "  [2] Abort merge and investigate"
    echo ""
    read -p "Choice [1/2]: " choice

    case "$choice" in
      1)
        echo "Proceeding with unresolved findings (will log in PR)"
        unresolved_note="**Note:** $unresolved_count deferred findings remain unresolved. See deferred_findings.md."
        ;;
      2)
        echo "Aborting. Review ${deferred_file} and resolve issues."
        exit 1
        ;;
      *)
        echo "Invalid choice. Aborting."
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac
  else
    echo "  ✓ All deferred findings resolved"
  fi
else
  echo "Note: No deferred_findings.md found. Skipping deferred findings check."
fi
```

**What this checks:**

| Classification | Verification | On Failure |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| `future-work-overlap` | File now exists | Warn user, offer to proceed or abort |
| `false-positive-factual` | None (logged for audit) | N/A |

**If unresolved findings:**
- Display warning with list of missing files
- User can proceed (logs in final PR) or abort to investigate
- Unresolved items added to final PR description

---

### 6. Integration Analysis

**Detect potential integration issues:**

```bash
# Check for files modified in both feature branch and main since divergence
merge_base=$(git merge-base main "$feature_branch")
feature_files=$(git diff --name-only "$merge_base" "$feature_branch")
main_files=$(git diff --name-only "$merge_base" main)

conflicts=$(comm -12 <(echo "$feature_files" | sort) <(echo "$main_files" | sort))

if [ -n "$conflicts" ]; then
  echo "Integration Notes:"
  echo "  ⚠ Files modified in both feature branch and main:"
  echo "$conflicts" | while read file; do
    echo "    - $file"
  done
  echo ""
  echo "  Recommendation: Review these files for merge conflicts"
else
  echo "Integration Notes:"
  echo "  ✓ No conflicts with current main"
fi
```

**Check for dependency changes:**

```bash
# Check if package.json or similar changed
if git diff main..."$feature_branch" --name-only | grep -qE 'package\.json|Gemfile|requirements\.txt|go\.mod|Cargo\.toml'; then
  echo "  ⚠ Dependencies changed"
  echo "    Review dependency updates before merging"
fi
```

### 7. Present Merge Review

**Consolidated review for user approval:**

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

### 8b. Greptile Review (Automated Loop)

**If `review.provider: greptile` in config.yaml, delegate to `/karimo:greptile-review`:**

This command handles the full Greptile review cycle:
1. Triggers @greptileai
2. Waits for review and parses score
3. Loops with automatic remediation until threshold met (max 3 loops)
4. Uses `karimo-greptile-remediator` agent for batch fixes
5. Model escalation (Sonnet → Opus) on architectural issues

```bash
# Check if Greptile is configured
review_provider=$(yq '.review.provider' .karimo/config.yaml 2>/dev/null)

if [ "$review_provider" != "greptile" ]; then
  echo "Note: No Greptile review configured. Skipping automated review."
  # Continue to CI validation
else
  echo "Starting Greptile review..."

  # Delegate to /karimo:greptile-review
  # This command owns the entire Greptile loop
  /karimo:greptile-review --pr $pr_number --internal

  greptile_result=$?

  case $greptile_result in
    0)
      echo ""
      echo "╭────────────────────────────────────────────────╮"
      echo "│  ✓ Greptile Review Passed                      │"
      echo "╰────────────────────────────────────────────────╯"
      echo ""
      echo "PR is ready for CI validation and human review."
      ;;
    1)
      echo ""
      echo "╭────────────────────────────────────────────────╮"
      echo "│  ⚠️  Greptile Review Had Transient Error        │"
      echo "╰────────────────────────────────────────────────╯"
      echo ""
      echo "Greptile review could not complete (timeout or API error)."
      echo "Continuing to CI validation..."
      ;;
    2)
      echo ""
      echo "╭────────────────────────────────────────────────╮"
      echo "│  ❌ Human Review Required                       │"
      echo "╰────────────────────────────────────────────────╯"
      echo ""
      echo "Greptile review loop exhausted (3 attempts)."
      echo "Remaining findings require human attention."
      echo ""
      echo "Options:"
      echo "  1. Review Greptile findings and fix manually"
      echo "  2. Accept the current score and merge"
      echo "  3. Close the PR and revisit the PRD"
      ;;
  esac
fi
```

**Why delegate to a separate command:**

1. **Session independence** — If the agent session ends after PR creation, the review can be resumed with `/karimo:greptile-review --pr {number}`
2. **Standalone usage** — Can be run on any PR, not just final merge PRs
3. **Clear ownership** — One command owns the entire Greptile flow
4. **Circuit breaker** — Built-in max 3 loops with model escalation

**Flow summary:**

```
/karimo:merge creates PR
    │
    ▼
/karimo:greptile-review --pr $pr_number
    │
    ├─► Trigger @greptileai
    │
    ├─► Parse score
    │
    ├─► If score >= threshold: exit 0 (passed)
    │
    ├─► If score < threshold:
    │     ├─► Extract P1/P2/P3 findings
    │     ├─► Spawn karimo-greptile-remediator
    │     ├─► Agent fixes findings in batch
    │     ├─► Push to PR branch
    │     ├─► Wait for Greptile re-review
    │     └─► Loop (max 3 times)
    │
    └─► If max loops reached: exit 2 (needs human)
```

### 9. Update Status

**Mark PRD as merging:**

```bash
jq --arg pr "$pr_number" --arg timestamp "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")" \
  '.status = "merging" | .final_pr_number = ($pr | tonumber) | .final_pr_created_at = $timestamp' \
  .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json > temp.json
mv temp.json .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json

git add .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json
git commit -m "chore(karimo): mark ${prd_slug} as merging

Final PR: #${pr_number}
Status: ready-for-merge → merging

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin "$feature_branch"
```

### 10. Auto-Merge (Optional)

**If `--auto-merge` is provided:**

```bash
# Wait for CI checks to pass
echo "Waiting for CI checks..."
gh pr checks "$pr_number" --watch

# Check all checks passed
if gh pr checks "$pr_number" | grep -q "fail"; then
  echo "❌ CI checks failed, cannot auto-merge"
  echo "   Review PR and merge manually: https://github.com/$OWNER/$REPO/pull/$pr_number"
  exit 1
fi

# Merge PR
gh pr merge "$pr_number" --squash --delete-branch

echo "✓ PR merged and feature branch deleted"
```

**Otherwise:**

```
Final PR created: #${pr_number}
View: https://github.com/$OWNER/$REPO/pull/$pr_number

Next steps:
  1. Review the PR
  2. Merge when ready (recommended: squash merge)
  3. Feature branch will be deleted after merge

When PR is merged, KARIMO will automatically:
  - Update status.json to "complete"
  - Record merge timestamp
  - Clean up task branches
```

### 11. Post-Merge Cleanup (Synchronous)

**This runs immediately after final PR merges — no webhook dependency.**

```bash
# For --auto-merge: runs after gh pr merge succeeds

## Error Handling

### Validation Failures

```
❌ Validation failed: Tests failed

Test output:
  FAIL src/components/ProfileForm.test.tsx
    ● ProfileForm › should handle avatar upload

      Expected mock function to have been called with:
        {uploadUrl: "http://example.com"}
      But was called with:
        {uploadUrl: undefined}

Fix the issue on feature branch and retry:
  1. Checkout feature branch: git checkout feature/user-profiles
  2. Fix failing tests
  3. Push changes: git push origin feature/user-profiles
  4. Retry merge: /karimo:merge --prd user-profiles
```

### Merge Conflicts with Main

```
⚠ Merge conflicts detected

Main branch has diverged since feature branch creation:
  - 3 new commits on main
  - 2 files conflict: src/types/user.ts, src/components/UserProfile.tsx

Resolution:
  1. Rebase feature branch on main:
     git checkout feature/user-profiles
     git rebase main
  2. Resolve conflicts
  3. Force push: git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-profiles
  4. Retry merge: /karimo:merge --prd user-profiles

Or use GitHub's merge UI to resolve conflicts in PR.
```

### Feature Branch Missing

```
❌ Feature branch not found: feature/user-profiles

This PRD's feature branch has been deleted or never created.

Check:
  - Was /karimo:run run for this PRD?
  - Was the feature branch accidentally deleted?

Recovery:
  - If tasks are complete but branch missing, create PR manually
  - If tasks incomplete, restart with /karimo:run --prd user-profiles
```

## Notes

- **Final PR recommended merge method:** Squash merge (consolidates all task commits into one)
- **GitHub auto-delete:** Configure GitHub to auto-delete branches after merge
- **CI/CD:** Final PR triggers production deployment (one deployment per PRD)
- **Greptile review:** Semi-automatic. If configured, KARIMO triggers @greptileai, parses findings, and attempts ONE automatic revision. If still below threshold after revision, human review is required.
- **Human review:** Required after (1) Greptile passes, (2) one revision attempt fails, or (3) Greptile times out
- **Branch cleanup:** Task branches deleted after final PR merges
