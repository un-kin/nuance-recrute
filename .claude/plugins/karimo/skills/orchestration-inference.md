# KARIMO Orchestration Inference Skill

Inference engine for recommending orchestration settings based on PRD complexity metrics. Used by the interviewer agent during Round 2.6.

---

## Purpose

This skill analyzes PRD complexity metrics and recommends optimal orchestration settings:
- Integration cadence (worktree, wave, feature)
- Review cadence (trigger, scope, on_findings)
- Gate placement and model selection

The inference engine uses deterministic decision trees — no guessing or randomness.

---

## Inputs

The inference engine accepts the following metrics from complexity assessment:

| Input | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `task_count` | number | Total tasks in PRD |
| `wave_count` | number | Total waves (from execution plan) |
| `total_points` | number | Sum of task complexity scores |
| `high_risk_count` | number | Tasks with complexity 7+ |
| `require_review_files` | number | Tasks touching files in `require_review` |
| `review_provider` | string | Configured provider: greptile, code-review, none |

---

## Decision Trees

### Integration Cadence

```
IF task_count < 8:
  cadence = "feature"
  reason = "Small PRD benefits from per-task review visibility"

ELIF task_count >= 15 OR total_points >= 200:
  cadence = "wave"
  reason = "Large PRD benefits from wave-level review checkpoints"

ELSE:
  cadence = "worktree"
  reason = "Standard workflow — efficient for medium PRDs"
```

### Review Cadence

```
IF review_provider = "none":
  trigger = "per-task"
  scope = "pr-diff"
  reason = "Manual review at task level"

ELIF review_provider = "greptile":
  # Greptile is $30/month flat — trigger doesn't affect cost
  IF task_count >= 15:
    trigger = "per-wave"
    scope = "wave-diff"
    reason = "Flat rate makes wave-level review cost-effective"
  ELSE:
    trigger = "per-task"
    scope = "pr-diff"
    reason = "Per-task review for smaller PRDs"

ELIF review_provider = "code-review":
  # Code Review is ~$20/PR — trigger affects cost directly
  IF total_points >= 200:
    trigger = "per-gate"
    scope = "cumulative"
    reason = "Cost optimization for large PRD"
  ELIF task_count >= 10:
    trigger = "per-wave"
    scope = "wave-diff"
    reason = "Balanced cost/quality for medium PRD"
  ELSE:
    trigger = "per-task"
    scope = "pr-diff"
    reason = "Per-task review for small PRD"
```

### Gate Placement

```
IF wave_count < 4:
  gates = []
  reason = "Small PRD doesn't need gates"

ELIF wave_count >= 8:
  # Place gates every max_waves_per_gate waves
  gate_interval = min(max_waves_per_gate, wave_count / 2)
  gates = [wave for wave in range(gate_interval, wave_count, gate_interval)]
  reason = "Large PRD benefits from periodic checkpoints"

ELSE:
  # Single gate at midpoint for medium PRDs
  gates = [round(wave_count / 2)]
  reason = "Medium PRD benefits from midpoint checkpoint"
```

### Gate Model Selection

```
IF high_risk_count >= 3:
  model = "pause"
  reason = "High-risk tasks require human oversight"

ELIF high_risk_count >= 1:
  model = "conditional"
  reason = "Some risk — auto-pass if tests/build green"

ELIF require_review_files > 0:
  model = "conditional"
  reason = "Sensitive files benefit from conditional gating"

ELSE:
  model = "skip-on-pass"
  reason = "Low risk — skip gates if conditions met"
```

---

## Output Format

The inference engine returns a structured recommendation:

```yaml
orchestration_recommendation:
  integration:
    cadence: "wave"
    auto_merge_on_green: true
    reason: "18 tasks across 6 waves — wave-level PRs provide review checkpoints"

  review:
    trigger: "per-wave"
    scope: "wave-diff"
    skip_if_diff_under: 0
    on_findings: "halt"
    reason: "Greptile at $30/month makes per-wave cost-effective"

  gates:
    model: "conditional"
    auto_place: true
    conditions:
      require_tests_pass: true
      require_build_pass: true
      max_critical_findings: 0
    placements:
      - after_wave: 3
        label: "Review core implementation"
      - after_wave: 5
        label: "Validate integration layer"
    reason: "Based on dependency structure and complexity distribution"
```

---

## Gate Label Generation

When `auto_place: true`, generate meaningful gate labels based on wave content:

```
FOR each gate_wave in placements:
  tasks_in_wave = get_tasks_up_to_wave(gate_wave)

  IF tasks contain "auth", "security", "permission":
    label = "Security review checkpoint"
  ELIF tasks contain "test", "spec", "validate":
    label = "Test coverage checkpoint"
  ELIF tasks contain "api", "endpoint", "route":
    label = "API integration checkpoint"
  ELIF tasks contain "migrate", "schema", "database":
    label = "Data layer checkpoint"
  ELIF gate_wave == midpoint:
    label = "Midpoint review"
  ELIF gate_wave == final_wave - 1:
    label = "Pre-completion review"
  ELSE:
    label = "Review wave {gate_wave} implementation"
```

---

## Cost Estimation

Include cost estimates in recommendations when review_provider is configured:

### Greptile ($30/month flat)

```
trigger: any → cost: $30/month
Note: Trigger affects timing, not cost
```

### Code Review (~$20/PR)

```
trigger: per-task   → cost: task_count × $20
trigger: per-wave   → cost: wave_count × $20
trigger: per-gate   → cost: gate_count × $20
trigger: on-umbrella → cost: $20
```

---

```

### Handling User Responses

**[Y] Accept:**
- Store recommendation in interview context
- Populate `.execution_config.json` during `/karimo:run`

**[C] Customize:**
Present each axis for override:

```
Integration Cadence:
  Current: wave
  Options: (1) worktree  (2) wave  (3) feature
  Selection [1/2/3]:

Review Cadence:
  Current: per-wave, wave-diff
  Trigger: (1) per-task  (2) per-wave  (3) per-gate  (4) on-umbrella
  Selection [1/2/3/4]:
  Scope: (1) pr-diff  (2) wave-diff  (3) cumulative
  Selection [1/2/3]:

Gate Model:
  Current: conditional
  Options: (1) pause  (2) conditional  (3) skip-on-pass
  Selection [1/2/3]:

Adjust gate placements? [y/N]:
```

**[S] Skip:**
- Use project defaults from `.karimo/config.yaml`
- No orchestration override stored

---

## Validation Rules

Before returning recommendations:

1. **Gate placement validation:**
   - Gates must be after waves that exist
   - No gate after final wave (execution completes naturally)
   - At least 2 waves between gates (avoid gate fatigue)

2. **Cadence compatibility:**
   - `trigger: per-gate` requires at least 1 gate
   - `scope: wave-diff` works best with `trigger: per-wave`
   - `scope: cumulative` works best with `trigger: per-gate` or `on-umbrella`

3. **Model compatibility:**
   - `skip-on-pass` only recommended when `high_risk_count = 0`
   - `pause` recommended when `high_risk_count >= 3`

---

## Example Scenarios

### Small Feature (5 tasks, 2 waves, 18 points)

```yaml
orchestration_recommendation:
  integration:
    cadence: "feature"
    reason: "Small PRD benefits from per-task review visibility"

    reason: "High-risk tasks require human oversight"
```

## Subscription Usage Estimation (v9.10)

Estimate PRD token usage and compare to user's subscription capacity.

### Capacity Constants

| Plan | Monthly Cost | ~5hr Window Capacity | Multiplier |
|------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Pro | $20 | ~44K tokens | Base |
| Max 5× | $100 | ~220K tokens | 5× Pro |
| Max 20× | $200 | ~880K tokens | 20× Pro |
| Team Standard | ~$25/seat | ~55K tokens/seat | 1.25× Pro |
| Team Premium | ~$100-150/seat | ~275K tokens/seat | 6.25× Pro |
| Enterprise | Custom | User-provided | Varies |

*Note: These are community-sourced estimates. Anthropic doesn't publish official limits.*

### Token Estimation Formula

```
PRD_TOKENS = PM_BOOTSTRAP + Σ(TASK_TOKENS)

PM_BOOTSTRAP = ~60K tokens (fixed overhead)

TASK_TOKENS:
  Sonnet (complexity 1-4): 15K + (complexity × 5K)
  Opus (complexity 5-10):  25K + (complexity × 10K)

Example:
  Sonnet task (complexity 3): 15K + (3 × 5K) = 30K tokens
  Opus task (complexity 7):   25K + (7 × 10K) = 95K tokens
```

### Capacity Calculation Logic

```
CAPACITY_MAP = {
  "pro": 44000,
  "max-5x": 220000,
  "max-20x": 880000,
  "team-standard": 55000,  # per seat
  "team-premium": 275000,  # per seat
}

IF plan IN ["pro", "max-5x", "max-20x"]:
  capacity = CAPACITY_MAP[plan]

ELIF plan IN ["team-standard", "team-premium"]:
  capacity = CAPACITY_MAP[plan] × team_seats

ELIF plan == "enterprise":
  IF enterprise_capacity > 0:
    capacity = enterprise_capacity
  ELSE:
    capacity = null  # Skip percentage, show tokens only

ELIF plan == "none":
  capacity = null  # Skip usage estimation
```

### Display Format (Round 2.6)

Include subscription usage estimation after orchestration recommendation:

**Standard Plan Example (Max 5×):**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Usage Estimate:
  PRD token usage: ~420K tokens (rough estimate)
  Your capacity (Max 5×): ~220K tokens / 5hr window
  Percentage: ~191% of 5hr capacity
  ⚠️  This PRD may span multiple 5hr windows

  Note: Estimates are approximate. Actual usage varies.
```

**Team Plan Example (Team Premium × 8):**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Usage Estimate:
  PRD token usage: ~420K tokens (rough estimate)
  Your capacity (Team Premium × 8): ~2.2M tokens / 5hr window
  Percentage: ~19% of 5hr capacity
  ✓ Well within your team's capacity

  Note: Estimates are approximate. Actual usage varies.
```

**Enterprise Plan Example (capacity provided):**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Usage Estimate:
  PRD token usage: ~420K tokens (rough estimate)
  Your capacity (Enterprise): ~1M tokens / 5hr window
  Percentage: ~42% of 5hr capacity

  Note: Estimates are approximate. Actual usage varies.
```

**Enterprise Plan Example (capacity skipped):**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Usage Estimate:
  PRD token usage: ~420K tokens (rough estimate)
  Enterprise plan: No capacity comparison (custom allocation)

  Note: Estimates are approximate. Actual usage varies.
```

**No Subscription Configured:**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Usage Estimate:
  PRD token usage: ~420K tokens (rough estimate)

  💡 Run /karimo:configure --subscription to see capacity comparison

  Note: Estimates are approximate. Actual usage varies.
```

### Percentage Interpretation

| Percentage | Indicator | Meaning |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| ≤50% | ✓ | Well within capacity |
| 51-100% | (none) | Fits within 5hr window |
| 101-200% | ⚠️ | May span 2 windows |
| >200% | ⚠️ | Likely spans multiple windows |
