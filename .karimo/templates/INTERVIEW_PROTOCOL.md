# PRD Interview Protocol (v5)

**Version:** 5.0
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for PRD interview structure and model assignment
**Output format:** See [PRD_TEMPLATE.md](PRD_TEMPLATE.md)
**Task schema:** See [TASK_SCHEMA.md](TASK_SCHEMA.md)

---

## Overview

The KARIMO interview system conducts structured interviews to produce agent-executable PRDs. This protocol defines the complete interview flow, agent roles, and output mapping.

**v7.0 Change:** Research is now loaded before the interview begins. The interviewer uses research findings to inform questions and validate assumptions.

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Model | When Spawned |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| `karimo-interviewer` | Conducts 4-round interview | Sonnet | `/karimo:plan` command |
| `karimo-investigator` | Scans codebase for patterns/files | Sonnet | Step 0 (auto) + Round 3 (opt-in) |
| `karimo-reviewer` | Validates PRD before saving | Sonnet | After Round 4 |

---

## Quick Reference

### Round to PRD Section Mapping

| Round | Name | Duration | PRD Sections Filled |
|-------|------|----------|---------------------|
| 0 | Auto-Detection | ~1 min | Project context (first run only) |
| 1 | Framing | ~5 min | §1 Executive Summary |
| 2 | Requirements | ~10 min | §3 Goals, §4 Requirements, §5 UX Notes |
| 2.5 | Complexity Assessment | ~1 min | Slicing recommendations (auto) |
| 2.6 | Orchestration | ~2 min | Orchestration recommendations (auto, v9.2) |
| 3 | Dependencies | ~5 min | §6 Dependencies, §7 Rollout, §8 Milestones |
| 4 | Retrospective | ~3 min | §10 Checkpoint Learnings |

### Model Assignment Rules

Task complexity determines which model executes the task:

| Complexity | Model | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 1–4 | Sonnet | Efficient for straightforward tasks |
| 5–10 | Opus | Complex reasoning, multi-file coordination |

**Assignment is deterministic:** There are no borderline cases or variants. A complexity score maps directly to a model.

### Complexity Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1-2 | Trivial | Single file, clear pattern, <50 lines |
| 3-4 | Standard | 2-3 files, established patterns, clear requirements |
| 5-6 | Moderate | 4-5 files, some coordination, new patterns |
| 7-8 | Complex | Multi-file coordination, architectural decisions |
| 9-10 | Very Complex | System-wide changes, complex state management |

---

## Step 0: Auto-Detection (First Run)

Before the interview starts, `/karimo:plan` checks `.karimo/config.yaml`:

**If first run (no config exists):**
1. Spawn investigator in `--mode context-scan`
2. Auto-detect runtime, framework, commands, boundaries
3. Present findings for user approval
4. Create `.karimo/config.yaml` with detected values

**If subsequent run:**
1. Spawn investigator in `--mode drift-check`
2. Report any configuration drift
3. User acknowledges changes

---

## Pre-Interview Setup

Before the first question, the interviewer:

1. Load project configuration from `.karimo/config.yaml`
2. **Load research context from `.karimo/prds/{slug}/research/findings.md`** (v7.0)
3. Load `.karimo/learnings/` for compound learning context (patterns, anti-patterns, project-notes, execution-rules)
4. Read previous PRDs from `.karimo/prds/` for retrospective context
5. Read this protocol and the PRD template

### Research Context (v7.0)

If research findings are available, the interviewer:

1. Summarizes key research findings at the start of Round 1
2. Uses discovered patterns to inform questions
3. References recommended libraries/approaches during Requirements round
4. Incorporates identified gaps into Dependencies round

**Research summary format:**

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Research Context                                    │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Based on research for this feature:

Key Patterns Found:
  • {pattern_name}: {brief description} (file:line)
  • {pattern_name}: {brief description} (file:line)

Recommended Approaches:
  • {approach}: {why recommended}

Identified Gaps:
  • {gap}: {impact}

These findings will inform the interview questions.
```

If no research is available (--skip-research flag used), the interviewer proceeds without research context and notes this limitation.

---

## Round 1: Framing (~5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Establish scope, success criteria, and risk.

**PRD sections filled:** §1 Executive Summary

### Research Context Summary (if available)

Before beginning core questions, present research findings:

> **Research Context for {slug}:**
>
> Based on codebase analysis and external research:
> - **Key patterns found:** {from research/internal/patterns.md}
> - **Recommended approaches:** {from research/external/best-practices.md}
> - **Identified gaps:** {from research/internal/errors.md}
>
> These findings will inform our interview questions.

If research is not available, skip this section and proceed to core questions.

### Core Questions (Always Ask)

1. **What are we building?** Describe the feature in plain language — what it does, not how it's built.
2. **What would you demo when this is done?** Walk through the screen, flow, output.
3. **What's the thing most likely to go wrong or take longer than expected?** The biggest risk.
4. **Is this MVP-get-it-working or polished-ship-it?** Ambition level for this phase.
5. **Who uses this? What's their workflow before and after?** Target user and workflow change.

### Conditional Follow-Ups

| Trigger | Follow-Up |
|---------|-----------|
| Data model changes | "What's the migration risk? Do you have a rollback strategy?" |
| External dependencies | "Are those ready now? Fallback if not ready?" |
| Tight deadline | "What can be cut? What's truly non-negotiable?" |

### Data Captured

- `executive_summary.one_liner`
- `executive_summary.done_looks_like`
- `executive_summary.primary_risk`
- `executive_summary.scope_type` (new feature / refactor / migration / integration)
- `executive_summary.target_user`

### Round Completion

After Round 1:
- Summarize what you heard in 2-3 sentences
- State the scope classification
- Confirm: "Does that capture it, or did I miss something?"

### Save and Commit

After user confirms framing:

1. **Write Executive Summary section** to `PRD_{slug}.md`
2. **Commit initial PRD structure:**

```bash
git add .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/PRD_{slug}.md
git commit -m "docs(karimo): add PRD framing for {slug}

Executive summary and scope definition completed.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

3. **Transition to Round 2**

---

## Round 2: Requirements (~10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Break the feature into concrete requirements with priorities.

**PRD sections filled:** §3 Goals, §4 Requirements, §5 UX Notes

### Question Flow

1. Walk through each sub-component or capability described in Round 1
2. For each component: "Is this a Must (blocks launch), Should (important but not blocking), or Could (nice to have)?"
3. For each **Must** requirement: "What are the specific acceptance criteria? If I handed you a PR, what would you check?"
4. For each **Should/Could**: "If we're running short on time or capacity, is this the first thing you'd cut?"
5. After stated requirements: "Are there requirements you're assuming that we haven't said out loud?"
6. "What should the agent definitely NOT do? What's off-limits for this feature?"

### Visual Assets Prompt

After capturing requirements, prompt for visual references:

> "Do you have any mockups, wireframes, or design references?
>
> If yes, drag them into: `.karimo/prds/{slug}/assets/`
>
> Say 'done' when ready, or 'skip' to continue."

If user adds files:
1. Run `node .karimo/scripts/karimo-assets.js import {slug}`
2. Review imported assets and their auto-generated names
3. Embed references in PRD Section 5 (UX & Interaction Notes)

### Conditional Follow-Ups

| Trigger | Follow-Up |
|---------|-----------|
| Requirement complexity > 6 | "This feels like it could be split. Can we break it into two tasks?" |
| Unclear boundaries | "Let's draw a hard line. What's in scope for this phase, and what gets pushed to next?" |
| UI work mentioned | "Are there design references, component patterns, or responsive requirements?" |
| Data work mentioned | "What are the validation rules? What does the error state look like?" |

### Data Captured

- `requirements[]` with priority, description, acceptance criteria
- `non_goals[]`
- Initial task decomposition

### Round Completion

After Round 2:
- Read back the prioritized requirement list
- Flag any requirements that feel too large for a single agent task
- Confirm: "This is what agents will be working from. Anything to add or change?"

### Save and Commit

After capturing all requirements:

1. **Write Goals, Requirements, and UX sections** to PRD
2. **Commit requirements sections:**

```bash
git add .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/PRD_{slug}.md
git commit -m "docs(karimo): add PRD requirements for {slug}

Goals, requirements, and UX notes completed.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

3. **Transition to Round 2.5**

---

## Round 2.5: Complexity Assessment (Auto-Generated)

**Purpose:** Surface complexity metrics, slicing recommendations, and model distribution before defining dependencies.

After capturing requirements and before defining dependencies, the interviewer auto-generates a complexity assessment:

### Assessment Display

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Complexity Assessment                                       │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Tasks: {task_count}
Total complexity: {total_points} points

Distribution:
  Sonnet (1-4): {sonnet_count} tasks
  Opus (5-10): {opus_count} tasks
  High-risk (7+): {high_risk_count} tasks

{slicing_recommendation}

Proceed to Dependencies? [Y] or discuss slicing [S]
```

### Slicing Recommendation Logic

**Auto-propose gates when ANY of:**
- ≥15 tasks
- ≥8 waves
- total_complexity ≥100 points
- Touches `require_review` paths from config.yaml

**Slicing thresholds (complexity-based):**

| Total Points | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| <100 | "No slicing needed" (unless task/wave triggers) |
| 100-200 | "Consider 2 slices with 1 gate" |
| 200-300 | "Recommend 3 slices with 2 gates" |
| 300+ | "Strong recommendation: 4+ slices" |

### Gate Boundary Heuristic

Tasks producing human decisions (audits, baselines, classifications — artifacts humans interpret) are gate-boundary candidates. The interviewer identifies these by looking for:

- Tasks with "audit", "review", "baseline", or "classify" in the title
- Tasks that output artifacts requiring human interpretation
- Tasks that inform subsequent architectural decisions

### Slicing Discussion (if user chooses [S])

If user selects "discuss slicing":

1. Present proposed slice boundaries:
   ```
   Proposed Slices:
     Slice 1: Waves 1-3 (tasks: 1a-2b) — Foundation
       Gate 1: After wave 3 — "Review baseline metrics"
     Slice 2: Waves 4-6 (tasks: 3a-4b) — Core features
       Gate 2: After wave 6 — "Validate core functionality"
     Slice 3: Waves 7-8 (tasks: 5a-5c) — Integration
   ```

2. Allow user to adjust:
   - Move gate boundaries
   - Add/remove gates
   - Name gates for clarity

3. Capture final slicing decision in PRD metadata

### Data Captured

- `complexity_assessment.total_tasks`
- `complexity_assessment.total_points`
- `complexity_assessment.sonnet_count`
- `complexity_assessment.opus_count`
- `complexity_assessment.high_risk_count`
- `complexity_assessment.slicing_recommended`
- `complexity_assessment.slices[]` (if configured)

### Round Completion

After Round 2.5:
- Confirm slicing decision (or "no slicing")
- Transition to Round 2.6 (Orchestration Recommendation)

---

## Round 2.6: Orchestration Recommendation (Auto-Generated)

**Purpose:** Recommend orchestration settings based on complexity metrics before defining dependencies.

**v9.2 Feature:** This round uses the `orchestration-inference` skill to generate intelligent recommendations.

### Inference Inputs

The inference engine uses data from Round 2.5:
- `task_count` — Total tasks
- `wave_count` — Total waves (from initial dependency analysis)
- `total_points` — Sum of complexity scores
- `high_risk_count` — Tasks with complexity 7+
- `require_review_files` — Tasks touching sensitive files
- `review_provider` — From project config.yaml

### Recommendation Display

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Orchestration Recommendation                                │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Based on complexity assessment ({task_count} tasks, {wave_count} waves, {total_points} points):

Integration Cadence: {cadence}
  {reason}

Review Cadence: trigger={trigger}, scope={scope}
  {reason}
  {cost estimate if applicable}

Gates: {gate_count} gates, model={model}
  {placements with labels}
  {reason}

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Y] Accept recommendations
[C] Customize settings
[S] Skip orchestration config (use defaults)
```

### User Response Handling

**[Y] Accept:**
- Store recommendation in interview context for `.execution_config.json`

**[C] Customize:**
- Present each axis (integration, review, gates) for override
- Allow adjustment of gate placements
- Store customized settings

**[S] Skip:**
- Use project defaults from config.yaml
- No override stored

### Data Captured

- `orchestration_recommendation.integration.cadence`
- `orchestration_recommendation.integration.auto_merge_on_green`
- `orchestration_recommendation.review.trigger`
- `orchestration_recommendation.review.scope`
- `orchestration_recommendation.review.on_findings`
- `orchestration_recommendation.gates.model`
- `orchestration_recommendation.gates.placements[]`
- `orchestration_recommendation.gates.conditions`

### Round Completion

After Round 2.6:
- Confirm orchestration settings (or "skip")
- Transition to Round 3 (Dependencies)

---

## Round 3: Dependencies & Architecture (~5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Establish task ordering, parallel opportunities, and file-level scope.

**PRD sections filled:** §6 Dependencies, §7 Rollout, §8 Milestones

### Question Flow

1. "Which requirements can be worked on independently — no shared state, no shared files?"
2. "Which ones must complete before others can start? What's the dependency chain?"
3. "Are there files that multiple requirements will touch?" (Explain file-overlap detection)
4. "Are there external blockers — APIs not ready, design decisions not made?"
5. "What's the testing strategy? Existing tests that must keep passing? New tests needed?"

### Investigator Agent (Opt-In)

Offer to spawn the investigator:

> "Codebase scan available to identify affected files and existing patterns. Proceed? [Y/n]"

If accepted, the investigator scans for:
- Affected files per task
- Existing patterns to follow
- File overlaps between tasks
- Import/dependency chains

Results populate `tasks[].files_affected` and `tasks[].agent_context`.

### Conditional Follow-Ups

| Trigger | Follow-Up |
|---------|-----------|
| File overlap detected | "Tasks [X] and [Y] both touch [file]. Should we restructure, or are you okay with them running sequentially?" |
| Shared service/utility mentioned | "Should we extract that as its own task — build the shared piece first?" |
| External blockers exist | "What's the fallback? If [blocker] isn't ready, can the agent stub it out?" |
| Cross-feature dependency | "That feature needs to be merged to main first. Should we mark this as an external blocker, or is that feature already shipped?" |

### Data Captured

- `external_blockers[]` — APIs, decisions, or dependencies not controlled by this PRD
- `cross_feature_blockers[]` — Features that must be merged to main before this PRD can execute
- `file_overlaps[]` — Files touched by multiple tasks (impacts parallelization)
- `dependency_chain` — Task ordering based on requirements
- `tasks[].depends_on`
- `tasks[].files_affected`

### Model Override (Optional)

After dependencies are captured, offer model override:

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Model Override (Optional)                                   │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Current assignments (from complexity):
  Sonnet: [1a], [1b], [1c]
  Opus: [2a], [3a]

Override any? [Y/n]
```

If user accepts override:
1. Present each task with current model
2. Allow forcing Opus for Sonnet tasks
3. Allow forcing Sonnet for Opus tasks (cost savings)
4. Capture overrides in task metadata

**Override Capture Format:**
```yaml
model_override:
  force_opus: ["1a", "1c"]  # Override Sonnet → Opus
  force_sonnet: ["3a"]       # Override Opus → Sonnet
```

### Round Completion

After Round 3:
- Present the dependency graph in text form
- Flag file overlaps
- Note any model overrides
- Confirm: "Does this ordering make sense?"

### Save and Commit

After capturing dependencies and rollout:

1. **Write Dependencies, Rollout, and Milestones sections**
2. **Commit dependency sections:**

```bash
git add .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/PRD_{slug}.md
git commit -m "docs(karimo): add PRD dependencies for {slug}

Dependencies, rollout plan, and milestones completed.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

3. **Transition to Round 4**

---

## Round 4: Retrospective (~3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Feed compound learning data into the current plan.

**PRD section filled:** §10 Checkpoint Learnings

### If No Previous PRDs

> "No checkpoint data from previous phases — we'll start collecting after this feature's first task completes. Do you have any general learnings from previous work you'd like to incorporate?"

### If Previous PRDs Exist

1. Summarize the latest checkpoint data:
   - "Patterns that worked well: [list]"
   - "Anti-patterns that were flagged: [list]"
   - "Cost estimates were [over/under] by [X]% on average"
   - "These files caused integration failures: [list]"
2. "Does any of this change how we should approach this feature?"
3. "Are there new rules we should add — things you want agents to always do or never do?"

### If .karimo/learnings/ Has Entries

1. Reference relevant learnings from the project's accumulated knowledge
2. Apply applicable patterns and anti-patterns to task context
3. Note any learnings that specifically apply to this feature's scope

### Data Captured

- Adjusted estimates
- Updated `agent_context` with retrospective patterns
- Learnings to add to `.karimo/learnings/{category}/`

### Round Completion

After Round 4:
- Note adjustments to task estimates and agent context
- Confirm: "Incorporating learnings. Generate PRD now? [Y/n]"

---

## Post-Interview: PRD Generation

After Round 4:

### 1. Generate PRD

Follow `.karimo/templates/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` structure.

### 2. Generate tasks.yaml

Create task definitions following `.karimo/templates/TASK_SCHEMA.md`.

### 3. Assign Models

Apply model assignment based on complexity:
- Complexity 1–4 → Sonnet
- Complexity 5–10 → Opus

Record model in each task entry.

### 4. Generate Execution Plan

Create `execution_plan.yaml` following `.karimo/templates/EXECUTION_PLAN_SCHEMA.md`.

### 5. Spawn Reviewer Agent

Spawn `karimo-reviewer` for validation with:
- Generated PRD content
- tasks.yaml
- execution_plan.yaml

### 6. Address Issues

If reviewer flags issues:
- Address each concern
- Re-submit for validation

### 7. Save Artifacts

On approval, save to PRD folder:
```
.karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/
├── PRD_{slug}.md
├── tasks.yaml
├── execution_plan.yaml
├── status.json (initial state)
├── findings.md (empty template)
├── dependencies.md (from template)
└── assets/
```

### 8. Commit Complete PRD

After saving all artifacts:

```bash
git add .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/PRD_{slug}.md .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/tasks.yaml .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/execution_plan.yaml .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/status.json .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/findings.md .karimo/prds/{NNN}_{slug}/dependencies.md
git commit -m "docs(karimo): complete PRD for {slug}

Retrospective learnings, task decomposition, and execution plan generated.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

Then spawn `karimo-reviewer` for validation.

**Note:** If reviewer finds issues and requires corrections, make a follow-up commit:
```bash
git commit -m "docs(karimo): fix PRD issues for {slug}

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

```

---

## Image Handling

Images can be added during the interview:
- Screenshots of UI mockups
- Figma exports
- Diagrams or flowcharts

**Manual Import Workflow:**

1. User drags files into `.karimo/prds/{slug}/assets/`
2. Agent runs `node .karimo/scripts/karimo-assets.js import {slug}`
3. Files are renamed with timestamps and added to manifest
4. Markdown references are generated for PRD embedding

**Example:**
```
User: I added some mockups to the assets folder.

Agent:
$ node .karimo/scripts/karimo-assets.js import user-profiles

✅ Imported: dashboard-mockup-20260319220000.png
   Was: Dashboard Mockup Final.png

Markdown references:
![dashboard-mockup](./assets/dashboard-mockup-20260319220000.png)

I've embedded this mockup in the UX section.
```

**Anytime Import:** User can add more images at any point. The import command is idempotent — it only processes new files.

Images are stored in `.karimo/prds/{slug}/assets/` (flat folder) and referenced using relative paths in the PRD: `./assets/filename.png`

---

## Round Completion Signals

Users signal readiness to proceed:
- "Ready to move on" / "Next" / "Proceed"
- "Done with this section" / "That covers it"
- "Continue" / "Move on"

The interviewer confirms and transitions to the next round.

---

## Session Resume

If the interview is interrupted:
- Claude Code maintains conversation context
- Re-running `/karimo:plan` continues from where you left off
- PRD progress is preserved in the conversation
