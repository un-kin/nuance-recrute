# PRD Research Section Template

This template defines the format for the `## Research Findings` section embedded in PRD files.

**Location:** Inserted into `PRD_{slug}.md` after overview, before tasks section

**Purpose:** Provide implementation context, patterns, and guidance to inform task brief generation

### Task-Specific Research Notes

**Task 1a: {Task Title}**

**Patterns to Follow:**
- Pattern from internal research (file:line reference)
- External best practice with source

**Known Issues to Address:**
- Issue identified in research
- Recommended solution approach

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Concrete implementation steps informed by research
- Libraries to use
- Files to reference or extend

**Dependencies:**
- File dependencies: Shared types, utilities (with paths)
- Library dependencies: npm packages to install
- Task dependencies: Must complete Task {X} first

### Research Artifacts

Full research details available in:
- Internal patterns: `.karimo/prds/{slug}/research/internal/`
- External research: `.karimo/prds/{slug}/research/external/`
- Imported research: `.karimo/prds/{slug}/research/imported/`

To refine this research:
1. Add annotations to research artifacts using `<!-- ANNOTATION -->` syntax
2. Run: `/karimo:research --refine --prd {slug}`

See `.karimo/templates/ANNOTATION_GUIDE.md` for annotation syntax.

## Template Usage Notes

**For karimo-researcher agent:**

1. Generate this section after completing research
2. Parse research artifacts from `research/internal/` and `research/external/`
3. Synthesize findings into above format
4. Embed into PRD after overview, before tasks
5. Include task-specific notes for each task
6. Link to full research artifacts at bottom

**For karimo-brief-writer agent:**

1. Read `## Research Findings` section from PRD
2. Extract task-specific notes for current task
3. Embed in brief's `## Research Context` section
4. Include pattern references, issues, guidance, dependencies

**For karimo-refiner agent:**

1. After processing annotations, regenerate this entire section
2. Mark refined findings with "Refined:" prefix
3. Update task-specific notes if affected
4. Preserve structure and format
